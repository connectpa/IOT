# IOT 
This project is a fork of [Thingsboard v2.4.1](https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard/tree/v2.4.1).

To setup and run this project, refer to the [Contribution Guide](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/contribution/how-to-contribute/#optional-nosql-database-cassandra).

**NOTE**

- currently this fork uses **HSQLDB**, so you won't need to setup any external database.
- on client startup it may give errors on `node-sass`: stop the execution and launch the command `npm rebuild node-sass`, then restart client.
